        The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method created by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s.
        The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals of 25 minutes separated by 5 minute breaks.
        \n\n
        These intervals are named pomodoros, the plural in English of the Italian word pomodoro
        (tomato), after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that Cirillo used as a university student.
        The method is based on the idea that frequent breaks can improve mental agility.
